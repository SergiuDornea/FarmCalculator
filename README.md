This Android mobile app built with Jetpack Compose should have the next functionalities in order to respond to a farmer business needs: 

ðŸ›ž Create a custom service, for example: plowing the land for a client ðŸšœ (set a price per kmÂ² or another unit of a measurement, price per unit of measurement for the service)

ðŸ›ž Create and save a service order, for example John Doe wants the user to plow his land of 100 kmÂ²:

        - when creating the service the final price for it shall be calculated when the service type is choosed by the user,
    and the necessary inputs are provided ( the size of the field )
    
        - the saved service should have a status: TO DO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, TO BE PAYED - to keep track of the workload
        
        - save client data in the order, for example: phone number or diffrent way of contact (maybe implements a way to call the client directly form the app)
    
ðŸ›ž Filter the saved orders
